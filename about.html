                            and I am not married. I go to school for the Philippine Science High School-SRCKC, and I
                            contributed in coding the article pages.</p>

                        <p>I'm 70 years old. I live near a palengke, I am not married. I got to work at the steert, I
                            get home at around 11 normally because I go bowling every Friday. I don't smoke, I don't
                            drink. I would say I like having friends, I am straight, and I like physics. I want to make
                            an impact on the world. I sleep at 10 6-10 hours of sleep per night. I created half the
                            articles and created some of the code.</p>

                        <p>Hello, I am someone who loves to read and learn, and I enjoy exploring new ideas. I also
                            spend my time with my friends and enjoy activities that keep me engage and active. I live a
                            balanced lifestyle, avoiding smoking & drinking, and I make sure to get enogh rest each
                            night. Through my coding projects, I contributed in coding the topic pages.</p>

                        <h3>RoCK</h3>
                        <p> I am RoCK. City K is my home, and Philippine Science High School -
                            SRCKC is the school label I own. I like surrounding myself in the warm,
                            though aggressive embrace of my friends, though I do enjoy the feeling of inner peace and
                            silence through isolation. I enjoy games that only require casual effort, or when characters
                            have interesting or cool animations. I absorb myself in topics where life and death are the
                            ruler of existing principles, though I would agree if some were to find it a strange topic
                            to discuss. I keep my sunken, low-edged thoughts to myself, though I do seem open to discuss
                            anything. My final goal in life is to find individuals that enjoy the torrents and thrills
                            of daily life, not just as a companion, but as a person that would be able to guide
                            themselves, and if that applies, with me, to reach the best that we can for the smile for
                            our tomorrow.</p>
