                        <p>The next one was in Davao on October 10 2025 with a magnitude of 7.4, the epicenter is
                            located
                            offshore near Manay, Davao Oriental</p>


                        <p>This caused residents to flee from their homes, and wide structural damage across Davao and
                            other
                            regions nearby.</p>


                        <p>The last of these three occurred on the same day, with a magnitude of 6.4, the epicenter
                            being
                            the
                            same as the last.</p>
                        <p>This caused more structural damage, causing buildings that were barely standing to fall, the
                            total
