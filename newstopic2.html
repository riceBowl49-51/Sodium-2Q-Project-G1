                            Duterte, currently 80, was apprehended and taken to “The Hague” on an arrest warrant
                            that attached him to deaths during his “war on drugs” where thousands of alleged
                            narcotics peddlers and users were killed.</p>

                        <p>“Mr. Duterte is not fit to stand trial as a result of cognitive impairment in multiple
                            domains. Mr. Duterte’s condition will not improve and, for this reason, the Pre-Trial
                            Chamber must adjourn all legal proceedings in his case indefinitely,” Kaufman said.</p>

                        <p>The ICC Prosecutor and legal representatives for the victims have generally opposed this
                            indefinite adjournment request, questioning the defense's medical conclusions.</p>

                            The court has consequently postponed confirmation of charges
                            hearings to formally address the defense's petition and is considering having its
                            own
                            medical expert assess Duterte's health.

                        <p>The families of the drug war victims have cited "conflicting narratives" about his health,

                        <p>A decision from the ICC on whether Duterte is medically fit to stand trial is anticipated to
                            be released in the coming weeks.
