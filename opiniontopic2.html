                            Racism back then in times where slavery was common and even encouraged.
                            Cotton farms that relied of people of color
                            and these farms ran the clothing industry giving things that people would wear. And labor
                            jobs were the backbones of society most
                            houses were created by people of color. In this era racism has actually become something
                            people joke about to make some laugh.

                            Even though this helped countries like the USA advance these left countries that they took
                            the workers from to basically die. Most slaves got treated horribly, they barely got fed,
                            would get punished for even small things and would get beaten so that they can work harder.
                            Being beat everyday while doing your job and not getting paid for it is simply inhumane.
                            Racial stereotypes have been a problem for people think that people that are this race will
                            act like that stereotype, an example of this is that black people are faster than any other
                            race. Racism has had many people even arrested because of the common stereotype of black
                            people are criminals. Even if it is used to make other people happy it should not come at
                            others dispense, unless the joke is about themselves which would make it better in a sense.

                                A solution of this could come in the system that almost all children have to go through,
                                the educational
                                system. If we teach the new generations how to properly treat other people we can
                                solve this problem,
                                some countries have tried this but most end in failure. Trying to actually make the
                                students stop bullying
                                people of color by giving them actual reasons instead of its saying that its just
                                bad and don’t do it.

                            In the end racism has lessened over the years slavery was its most extreme case, in todays
                            era there is a solution that could be implemented easily. But no the only question is can
                            the world unite to stop racism.
